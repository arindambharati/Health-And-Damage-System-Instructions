# Assets

Assets are a very important part fo your game as they make it look beatiful and attractive to play.

The assets for your game will depend on your vision of the game. 

There is a huge library of assets that are available online for free. You can also use the Unity asset store here : [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com)

Unbelievable right?

In the project repository, you will find some free assets that you can use as well in the branch called Problem-Statement, of course you can import any other models too.

# Importing Assets

For any created models, you can use the import function to get any model inside of a unity scene.

# Sprite or Image Renderer

Once the models or images are imported, you can use the Sprite or Image Renderer component for any gameobject to render the sprite/image onto the GameObject. Click on "Add Component" -> "Sprite Renderer" in the inspector after adding an Emmpty Gameobject.

You can see in the repository for the project provided, the sprites are already added for you. Image has been used in this case to render it on to the Gameobject.

Gameobjects in scene:

Remember you need to place the Gameobject using Transform component appropriately in the scene.
